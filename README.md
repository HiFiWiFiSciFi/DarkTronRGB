# DarkTronRGB
DarkTronRGB is a collection of override styles for use with the website devRant.com. Tested using Stylebot, but any CSS injector plugin should probably work.

&nbsp;
# 1. Install a Browser User Script Plugin
Tested with Styler for Firefox and Stylebot for Chrome... but any plugin that lets you inject user styles into web pages should work.

&nbsp;
# 2. Cut & Paste the CSS from the Red, Blue, or Green CSS file.
That's it. You're done.

Don't like it? You're a developer. Fix it. Still don't like it, turn if off.

Thanks to @dfox for the cool website... I just wanted to make it a little bit cooler.
